# Hi, I'm Jack

- I'm a PhD student at the University of Bristol studying Artificial Intelligence supervised by [Laurence Aitchison](https://github.com/LaurenceA/)
- Over winter 2024/25, I'll be undertaking an internship in Software Engineering at [Snowflake](https://github.com/snowflakedb) in Berlin
- My [current research](https://jackhanslope.com/publications/neural-nets-data-cleaning/) is focused on utilizing supervised learning techniques to enhance short-term predictions of low-dimensional variables in weather datasets
- Previously I had been developing [new techniques](https://jackhanslope.com/publications/imitating-careful-experts/) for inverse reinforcement learning.
- I'm part of the [CDT in Interactive AI](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/) and the [Bristol Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://bristolcnu.github.io/)
